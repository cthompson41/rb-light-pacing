-Pace assist functionality
---Would be nice to give user more control over how pace assist works. Could have a default setting, and then have where they can control through the gui how the light strips are turned off/on for certain laps. Maybe read in a file that is formatted in a certain way, maybe popup a new window that allows them to control it 

-Football Addition
---Add Acceleration

-Track
--pixelPositions[i] = (long)(position * 12000/trackLength); (I think it should still just be 48) (mapping should include trackLength instead)


-Start Button
--Add sound and maybe time delay when clicked? (It feels like we just need a goodw way at the expo to trigger people)
